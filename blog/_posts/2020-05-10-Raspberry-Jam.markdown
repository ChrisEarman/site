Raspberry Jam
-

Ingredients:
- `~1 lb` fresh raspberries 
- `Â½ cup` granulated sugar
- `2 tablespoons` fresh lemon juice
- `pinch` salt 

Steps:
1. Place the `raspberries`, `sugar`, `lemon juice`, and `salt` into a saucepan.
2. Begin to cook the mixture on medium-high heat as you mash the mixture using a potato masher or large fork.
3. Boil for `20 minutes` then check for done-ness using the spoon check.
4. This will produce ~2 `8 oz` mason jars worth of jam, which you can now pour the mixture into once it passes the 
spoon check. 
5. Let sit at room temp for a few hours with the lids on prior to moving to the fridge for longer term storage. 


*Spoon Check: place a few spoons in the freezer to cool. When ready to check, quickly dip the spoon in the jam, or drip
a few drops onto the back of the spoon. Wait a few seconds for it to cool and run your finger down the middle. If the mixture
fills back in the gap, it is not yet ready. If the mixture holds that streak, then it has set and is ready to cool.*
