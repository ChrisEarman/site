-

Ingredients:
- `2` egg whites
- `½ cup` granulated sugar (~ `100 grams`)
- `1 teaspoon` vanilla extract 

Steps:
1. Place the `egg whites` the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and start whisking on high.
2. With the mixer running, gradually add the `sugar` into the mixture. 
3. Whisk on high until you form stiff (but not dry) peaks, the mixture should be smooth and not gritty when pressed 
between your thumb and forefinger.
4. Stir in the `vanilla`.
5. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag or plastic bag, then cut the tip. (see photos for more details)
6. Pipe the mixture onto a parchment or silicon lined backing sheet using a circular motion tor form little swirls.
7. Bake at `300℉` for `35 minutes` until they are dry but not brown. 
8. Turn off the oven and let the meringues cool gradually while inside.

Here is a picture of what the "stiff but not dry" peaks look like.

When moving the mixture into the plastic bag for piping, a common technique is to place the tip of the bag into a tall
glass or jar, and to have the end of the bag folded over the top, like so.

Then you can use a rubber spatula to place and press the mixture into the bag.

Now you can pull the bag out of the glass, and twist it to collect the mixture into one corner of the bag.

Then with a pair of scissors, you can cut the tip of the above pouch, and apply pressure to extrude the mixture onto the 
lined baking sheet.

As you can see, the cooked and raw forms look fairly similar, but the cooked form did expand to some degree.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188265593@N07/49931935751/in/datetaken-public/" title="IMG_1658"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49931935751_6daebbc4af_c.jpg" alt="IMG_1658"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

One note that I had on my attempt at this recipe is that the meringues were fairly hollow. Im not sure if this is due to 
me opening and closing the oven too much or letting them cool too quickly or cooking them for too high initially. 

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188265593@N07/49931935921/in/datetaken-public/" title="IMG_1661"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49931935921_eca5868b3b_c.jpg" alt="IMG_1661"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Possibly if I were to try this again, I would look to see how to keep the internal texture more consistent, possibly by 
adding `Cream of Tartar` which some recipes call for, for the explicit purpose of stabilizing the structure. But in the 
end it was still a very tasty desert, and the pockets of air caused by this hollow interior was the perfect vessel for 
some sweet and tart jams.
