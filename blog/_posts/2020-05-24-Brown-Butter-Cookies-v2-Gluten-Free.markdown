v1 Recipe: [Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies](/blog/2020/04/27/BA-Brown-Butter-Cookies.html)

Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies v2 (GF)
-
This is the same recipe as my original [Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies](/blog/2020/04/27/BA-Brown-Butter-Cookies.html)
from a BA test kitchen recipe, just with the substitution of gluten free flour, and leaving them in the fridge 
for the dough to hydrate and cool before baking. 

Ingredients:
- `200 grams` GlutenFree flour substitute (`1½ cups`)
- `4 grams` kosher salt (`1¼ tsp` Diamond Crystal or `¾ tsp` Morton kosher salt)
- `4 grams` baking soda (`¾ tsp`)
- `169 grams` unsalted butter, divided (`1½ sticks`)
- `200 grams` dark brown sugar (`1 cup packed`)
- `50 grams` granulated sugar (`¼ cup`)
- `1` large egg
- `2` large egg yolks
- `2 tsp` vanilla extract
- `6 oz` bittersweet chocolate chunks / chips

Steps:
1. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven, preheat to 375℉.
2. Whisk `flour`, `salt`, and `baking soda` in small bowl.
3. Cook 1 stick of the `butter` in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often
and scraping the bottom with a heatproof spatula until butter foams, then browns,
about 4 minutes. Then transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. 
4. Cut the remaining half stick of `butter` into the warm brown butter, it should melt but not foam or sizzle.
5. Once melted, add both `sugars` and whisk, breaking up any clumps until incorporated. 
6. Add `egg` and `yolks` and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, ~30s. 
7. Whisk in the `vanilla`.
8. Fold `reserved dry ingredients` into butter mixture until no dry spots remain, then fold in `chocolates`
9. Roll the dough into a tube shape in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight and up to a few days.
9. Cut the dough into disks out of the tube and place on a lined baking sheet.
10. Bake for 8-10 minutes until deep golden brown and firm around the edges.

Thoughts:
- 
The last time I made this recipe, I went straight from the mixing bowl to the oven. This meant that the flour hadnt
fully hydrated and the fats from the butter were still very soft/liquid. This ultimately resulted in cookies that 
were flatter than I generally like. To combat this, I opted to use a technique from my 
[Peanut Butter Cookies v1](/blog/2020/03/23/Peanut-Butter-Cookies-v1.html) recipe of refrigerating them in a tube 
overnight, which helps cool down the fats and gives the flour (or in this case flour substitute) more time to hydrate.

Looking back at my earlier posts, I realized I never showed what the cookie tube looks like, here are a few picture 
examples of the process. 

First I place 2 sheets of plastic wrap on the table, one on top of another.

Then loosely place the dough on the plastic wrap in a line.

Using a rubber spatula, form the dough into a more cohesive line.

Wrap the plastic wrap around the line of dough and roll it into more of a cylindrical shape before placing it in the fridge.

<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/188265593@N07/49932244657/in/datetaken-public/" title="IMG_1648"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49932244657_3700b846f5_c.jpg" alt="IMG_1648"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

At this point the dough is still soft and will flatten a bit on the bottom side while solidifying in the fridge, 
feel free throughout this process to roll it while in the wrap to get it closer to a circular shape, or to reform the 
dough into circles as you cut it for cooking.
