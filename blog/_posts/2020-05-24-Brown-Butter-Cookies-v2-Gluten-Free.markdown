v1 Recipe: [Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies](/blog/2020/04/27/BA-Brown-Butter-Cookies.html)

Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies v2 (GF)
-
This is the same recipe as my original [Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies](/blog/2020/04/27/BA-Brown-Butter-Cookies.html)
from a BA test kitchen recipe, just with the substitution of gluten free flour, and leaving them in the fridge 
for the dough to hydrate and cool before baking. 

Ingredients: 
{% highlight diff %}
< - `200 grams` all purpose flour (`1½ cups`)
---
> - `200 grams` GlutenFree flour substitute (`1½ cups`)
{% endhighlight %}

Steps:
{% highlight diff %}
< - 9. Scoop dough into ~16 balls on parchment lined baking sheets.
---
> - 9. Roll the dough into a tube shape in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight and up to a few days.
> - 9.1. Cut the dough into disks out of the tube and place on a lined baking sheet.
{% endhighlight %}


Thoughts:
- 
The last time I made this recipe, I went straight from the mixing bowl to the oven. This meant that the flour hadnt
fully hydrated and the fats from the butter were still very soft/liquid. This ultimately resulted in cookies that 
were flatter than I generally like. To combat this, I opted to use a technique from my 
[Peanut Butter Cookies v1](/blog/2020/03/23/Peanut-Butter-Cookies-v1.html) recipe of refrigerating them in a tube 
overnight, which helps cool down the fats and gives the flour (or in this case flour substitute) more time to hydrate.

Looking back at my earlier posts, I realized I never showed what the cookie tube looks like, here are a few picture 
examples of the process. 

First I place 2 sheets of plastic wrap on the table, one on top of another.

Then loosely place the dough on the plastic wrap in a line.

Using a rubber spatula, form the dough into a more cohesive line.

Wrap the plastic wrap around the line of dough and roll it into more of a cylindrical shape before placing it in the fridge.

At this point the dough is still soft and will flatten a bit on the bottom side while solidifying in the fridge, 
feel free throughout this process to roll it while in the wrap to get it closer to a circular shape, or to reform the 
dough into circles as you cut it for cooking.
