Variation on: [Sourdough Bread v1](/blog/2020/04/18/Sourdogh-Bread-v1.html), [v2](/blog/2020/04/25/Sourdogh-Bread-v2.html)

Sourdough Bread v3 - Whole Wheat:
- 
This recipe produces one (1) loaf.

Ingredients:
- Levain
    - `20 grams` all purpose flour
    - `20 grams` whole wheat flour
    - `20 grams` mature starter 
    - `40 grams` water 
- Dough
    - `250 grams` unbleached all purpose flour
    - `200 grams` whole wheat flour
    - `340 grams` water @ 90℉
    - `9 grams` salt
    
    
Steps:
1. Mix `levain ingredients` and rest in a warm area for `5 hours`.
2. `1 hour` before the levain is done, mix together the `bread flour`, `whole wheat flour`, and `290g of the water`. (reserve 50g of water for later)
3. Mix until the dough comes together, then cover with plastic wrap and rest in a warm area for the remaining hour
we are waiting on the levain. 
4. Mix the `dough` and the `levain` together using a bit (but not all) of the reserved `water` to help incorporate it. One
method for incorporation is to pinch the levain into the dough. Let rest for `20 minutes`.
5. Add the `salt` and remaining `water` and mix until incorporated. [Slap and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=717) 
for 2-4 minutes, until the dough is smooth and begins to catch some air. Rest for `15 minutes` in a warm area.
6. Preform 6 sets of [Stretch and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=811) spaced out `15 minutes` apart for the 
first 3 rounds, then spaced out `30 minutes` apart for the last 3. Make sure the dough rests in a warm area in between
stretches.
7. Let your dough rest for a remainder of `1.5 hours` after the final stretching. 
8. Dump out the dough and shape it into a small boule and let sit a few minutes.
9. [Shape your dough](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=938) and place it into bannetons (or a large mixing bowl)
lined with a flour dusted cloth.
10. Chill in the fridge `overnight`.
11. Preheat cast iron dutch oven in the oven from cold to 500℉ for `1 hour`. 
12. Roll parchment paper onto your workbench and flip dough from the bowl onto it. Score the dough with a sharp knife or 
razor blade down the middle at a 45° angle.
13. Pull the dutch oven out and carefully lift and place the parchment paper holding the dough into the dutch oven using 
heat proof gloves. Bake for `20 minutes`.
14. Remove the top from the dutch oven and place the dutch oven on a room temperature baking sheet, 
    then lower the oven to 450℉ and bake for an additional `20-30 minutes` 
    until the loaf is a deep brown.
15. Remove the loaf from the dutch oven and let it rest on a wire rack `a few hours` until it is room temperature.


Diff:
-

I felt pretty comfortable making the sourdough loaves, so I wanted to try out different flour ratios to see how that 
affects the bread. 

Ingredients:
- Dough
{% highlight diff %}
<  - `405 grams` bread flour (or all purpose)
<  - `40 grams` whole wheat flour 
---
>  - `250 grams` unbleached all purpose flour
>  - `200 grams` whole wheat flour
{% endhighlight %}


I also tried a different score pattern which helped to avoid any bursting at other locations in the crust.
