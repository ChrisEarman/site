Corn Tortilla
-
The below portioning makes around 8 tortillas, scale up as necessary. 


Ingredients:
- `120 grams` Corn Flour
- `¾ cups` warm water
- `½ teaspoon` salt

Steps:
1. In a large bowl, mix the `corn flour`, `water`, and `salt` with a wooden spoon or silicon
spatula until incorporated. 
2. Use your hands to knead the dough for `2-3 minutes` until it is smooth and forms a cohesive ball. This should 
be a similar texture to Play-doh. 
3. Cover the dough with a damp kitchen towel and let rest for `10 minutes`.
4. Portion the dough into balls `~35-40 grams` and use your hands to roll it into a ball.
5. Pres the dough flat between two pieces of plastic, this can be done with a tortilla press, or by using a large 
pan against the table. For plastic I used a ziploc back which I cut open. This will yield tortillas that are 
`~4-5 inches` 
6. Heat a non-stick or cast iron pan on medium-high heat. Gently peel the plastic off the tortillas and cook for `60 seconds`
per side.
7. Remove the tortilla from the skillet, placing it on and covering it with a clean towel on a plate to keep warm. 
8. Repeat for the rest of the dough. 

Thoughts:
- 
These tortillas were much quicker and easier to make than their flour counterparts I've made in the past.

The dough came together really well and was ultimately much less sticky / oily than the flour tortilla counterpart.

This made it especially easy to form and press between the ziploc bag I butchered to help the process along.

After that point the process is a lot like the flour tortillas, cooking on the cast iron and storing in a towel to keep warm.
