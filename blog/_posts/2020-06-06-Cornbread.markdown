Cornbread:
-

This recipe was something I ended up wanting to try out to make use of my excess buttermilk produced from my 
[cultured butter]((/blog/2020/04/19/Cultured-Butter.html))

Ingredients:
- `1 cup` Medium grind cornmeal
- `1⅓ cup` buttermilk 
- `1 cup` all purpose flour
- `¼ cup` sugar
- `2 tsp` baking powder
- `½ tsp` baking soda
- `½ tsp` salt
- `2` eggs
- `¼ cup` or `½ stick` melted butter (cooled)

Steps:
1. Mix together the `cornmeal` and `buttermilk` in a large bowl. Let sit for `10 minutes`.
2. Meanwhile, preheat an oven to 375℉.
3. Prepare an `8x8` pan by spraying it or coating it with a thin layer of butter with a paper towel. 
4. Mix together the `flour`, `sugar`, `salt`, `baking powder`, and `baking soda` in separate bowl.
5. Add the `flour mixture`, `eggs`, and `melted butter` to the `cornmeal mixture`.
6. Mix together until thoroughly combined. 
7. Transfer to the `8x8` pan and bake until golden, and a toothpick or paring knife inserted in the center comes 
out clean. About `25-30 minutes`.
8. Let cool slightly before serving.

To butter the pan I used room temp or slightly chilled butter and a paper towel to spread it around a the pan and into the corners.

The bread is very easy to remove so long as you butter the pan thoroughly, just inverting the pan should release it.
