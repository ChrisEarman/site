Oven Roasted Salsa:
-
This recipe doesnt have one true source, I had a few ingredients laying around that I thought could make a salsa and
followed some loose guidelines from various sources online. I'll list what I used here but it should be a fairly forgiving
process.

Ingredients: 
- `some number` of cherry tomatoes
- `one` red onion
- `two` large jalapenos 
- `a few cloves` of garlic
- `a handful` of cilantro 
- `one` lime
- `a few pinches` of salt

Steps:
1. Remove the stems from the `jalapenos` and `tomatoes`, then skin the `red onion` and `garlic cloves`.
2. Quarter the `red onion` and place it on an oven prove skillet with the `jalapenos`, `tomatoes`, and `garlic cloves`.
3. Broil in the oven for `5-15 minutes`, rotating part way through to get a nice char on both sides. 
The time and temperature of the broiling is less important here than the end product, just keep an eye on it to make sure 
it gets a nice char before removing. 
4. Remove from the oven, add to a blender and let cool for `~10 minutes`. You can skip this phase if you are hungry now,
it just helps avoid wilting the `cilantro`. 
5. Add the `cilantro`, the juice of one `lime`, and a few pinches of `salt` to the blender and pulse the salsa together until it is at the incorporation 
and texture you desire. 
6. Pour what you want now into a bowl to eat, or place in a jar in the fridge to cool and store.

This was one of those recipes where the ingredients were much more photogenic than the end product itself.

This is what my level of char was looking like a few minutes the low setting

I then cranked it onto high and rotated to produce this.

Then blended everything together.

I'm a fan of both chunky and smooth salsas, but to get things better incorporated I ended up blending longer and making 
a smoother salsa.
