- `5 grams` salt
- `15 grams` olive oil
- `25 grams` whole wheat flour
- `225 grams` all purpose flour
- `180 grams` water

incorporated. then Cover and allow to ferment at room temperature overnight.
2. The **morning of** preform some stretch and folds on the dough, then cover and place in the fridge for `up to 36 hours`.
3. The **night of** remove the dough and let rest for `30 min` at room temp. 
4. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces, and shape into a ball, then cover and rest for `30 minutes`.
5. Turn on the broiler of your oven and heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
6. Press one of the dough balls into an 8" circle on a floured surface, adding flour as needed to prevent sticking. 
7. When the skillet is smoking hot, lay the dough onto the skillet and place your sauce and toppings on teh crust.
8. Cook for `5-6 minutes` on the stove top until the bottom crust is starting to crisp.
9. Transfer the cast iron to the broiler to finish baking the top of the pizza for `2-4 minutes`.


Thoughts:
- 
I had some hydration issues with this dough, it was supper liquid and wouldn't hold its shape. This meant that I ended 
up needing to plop it into the pain and stretch it in the hot pan (not recommended) which I think adversely affected the
end product. The original post by [Little Spoon Farm](https://littlespoonfarm.com/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe/) on this 
recipe notes how you can dial down the water measurements initially and then add more during the initial mix. Another 
thing I could have done to help the dough keep its form is kneed / stretch and fold it more to get more gluten development.

As you can see the wet dough flattened out more than one might expect.

It also required constant flour to be added to keep it workable.

The end product still turned out fairly well, but no better than other active dry yeast recipes I've tried in the past.

It was a fun experiment but it did make me realize that I'm not a huge fan of the sourdough taste in conjunction with 
standard pizza toppings. If I try this again I might opt for less conventional toppings or just stick to a non-sour dough
pizza crust.
