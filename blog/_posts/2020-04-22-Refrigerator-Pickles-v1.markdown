Refrigerator Pickles
-
Ingredients:
- `10-12` Pickling cucumbers 
- `4 cups` water (`2 parts`)
- `2 cups` vinegar (`1 parts`)
- `2 tablespoons` kosher salt
- `1 teaspoon` sugar 
- `big bunch` of dill
- `1 head` of garlic (skins removed, cloves smashed)
- `10` peppercorn kernels

Steps:
1. Slice `cucumbers` into desired shape, slices or spears.
2. Combine `water`, `vinegar`, `salt`, and `sugar` in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil and swirl to dissolve solids. Remove from heat
and let cool to room temperature. 
3. Add `cucumbers` to jars, add `dill`, `garlic`, and `peppercorns` as well.
4. Add enough brine to the jars to cover the cucumbers.
5. Seal and refrigerate for at least 1 week. Pickles should be good 
for at least 4-6 weeks.


Thoughts:

The recipe calls for 10-12 cucumbers but I've had a lot of success pickling 
other produce like jalape√±os and bell peppers. Basically pick whatever you want 
to pickle and use as many you can fit in the jar you have.
