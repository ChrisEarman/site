Refrigerator Pickles
-
Ingredients:
- `10-12` Pickling cucumbers 
- `4 cups` water (`2 parts`)
- `2 cups` vinegar (`1 parts`)
- `2 tablespoons` kosher salt
- `1 teaspoon` sugar 
- `big bunch` of dill
- `1 head` of garlic (skins removed, cloves smashed)
- `10` peppercorn kernels

Steps:
1. Slice `cucumbers` into desired shape, slices or spears.
2. Combine `water`, `vinegar`, `salt`, and `sugar` in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil and swirl to dissolve solids. Remove from heat
and let cool to room temperature. 
3. Add `cucumbers` to jars, add `dill`, `garlic`, and `peppercorns` as well.
4. Add enough brine to the jars to cover the cucumbers.
5. Seal and refrigerate for at least 1 week. Pickles should be good 
for at least 4-6 weeks.

The recipe calls for 10-12 cucumbers but I've had a lot of success pickling 
other produce like jalape√±os and bell peppers. Basically pick whatever you want 
to pickle and use as many you can fit in the jar you have. 

The first step to pickling is picking and cutting your desired pickling products. Here I decided to pickle cucumbers in 
spear and coin cuts, as well as bell and jalapeno peppers.

The next step is to pack them into your pickling jars (I'm using [Weck's](https://weckjars.com)) with everything except the brine.

Then add the brine, seal and refrigerate a week. As you wait you can try your pickles every few days until they are pickled to your liking.
