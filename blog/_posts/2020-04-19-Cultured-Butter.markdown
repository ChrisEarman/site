Cultured Butter
-

Ingredients:
- `1 quart` high quality heavy cream (NOT ultra pasteurized) (no stabilizers added)
- `3 tablespoons` culture agent
  - cultured buttermilk OR
  - plain unsweetened yogurt with live cultures OR
  - cultured sour cream OR
  - creme fraiche
- `1/4 teaspoon` kosher salt (optional)

Steps:
1. *Culture the Cream* - combine `cream` and `culturing agent` in a lidded container, stir to combine.
2. Allow cream mixture to sit at room temp for at least 24-48 hours, leave longer if you want a 
stronger more pronounced tangy flavor.
3. Transfer to the fridge and chill for at least one hour. This helps the butter fats
firm up and not become greasy during churning. 
4. *Churn* - Place chilled cream mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer.
5. Whisk on medium-high speed (covered with a towel to prevent splattering) until texture resembles a soft whipped cream.
6. Reduce speed to medium-low and continue whipping until the liquid and butter fat just begin to separate. 
7. Reduce speed to low, be sure to cover the mixture as it will splatter at this step. Whip until the butter comes 
together as a solid. 
8. *Strain* - Set a large fine meshed sieve over a large bowl, you can line it with muslin if desired. 
Pour out the liquid and move the butter to the sieve. Gently press with a spatula
to release additional liquid (without pushing it through the sieve). 
9. Transfer liquid to a separate container, this is *home-made buttermilk* and it will keep in the fridge up to 2 weeks. 
10. *Wash* - Transfer butter to the empty mixing bowl. Add very cold water to the bowl and press the butter around with 
a rubber spatula. This will turn the liquid milky. Empty out the water and repeat until the water runs clear. This processes 
is releasing the excess buttermilk trapped in pockets in the butter. 
11. Add salt if desired, but I've found just adding flaky salt on top of whatever you butter. 
12. Store in airtight container or divided into bars wrapped in parchment or wax paper.

After a few days of sitting at slightly above room temp, the cream mixture has thickened considerably and has a tangy smell.

It now has a consistency resembling a greek yogurt, much thicker than the cream that initially went in.

This is what it looked like in the bowl prior to any whipping.

After the first round of whipping it is starting to resemble a whipped cream.

After a bit more whipping you can see the cream starting to appear to curdle.

After significantly more whipping we can see the buttermilk starting to separate from the milk fats.

After the buttermilk has separated, we construct a straining apparatus to help further strain the two, using cheese cloth and a sieve.

Now with the fats separated we can use ice water to start washing the butter.

On the first few washes the water will run milky, as we start to remove the buttermilk that's still trapped in the butter. 
But eventually it will run clear, at which point washing has completed.

This should leave a smooth textured butter behind.

Now that we've finished you can weigh and store the butter however you see fit. I put some in a tub and some i pressed 
into a rectangle in parchment paper.
