This recipe was a last minute addition to our 4th of July, quarantine festivities. 

Ingredients:

- sugar / agave syrup to taste 

Steps:
1. Cut a `watermelon` in half, scooping half out into a blender. 
2. Blend the `watermelon` until no large chunks remain, it should produce `~7 cups` of slush. 
3. Add `1 cup vodka` and the juice of `1 lime` to the blender and pulse to mix. 
4. In a glass, muddle a few leaves of `mint` with `sugar` or `syurp`.

Get a roommate to cut the watermelon in half for you.
