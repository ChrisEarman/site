Hot Oven Roasted Salsa:
-
This recipe has a fairly haphazard composition, similar to my original two oven roasted salsa posts, feel free to experiment 
with the ratios. Produces `~16oz` of salsa.

Ingredients:
- `1 container` orange cherry tomatoes 
- `2 cloves` garlic
- `1` white onion (quartered)
- `3` habenero peppers (honestly, probably `1` is fine)
- `2-4 oz` lime juice 
- olive oil 
- salt
- sugar

Steps:
1. Peel the `garlic` and peel + quarter the `onion`. 
2. Place the `tomatoes`, `habeneros`, `onion`, and `garlic` in a cast iron pan.
3. Place the pan in the oven under a broiler for `10-20` minutes, flipping occasionally until a nice char 
forms around the tomatoes and peppers. 
4. Transfer the pan's contents to a blender with a pinch `salt`, a pinch `sugar`, the `lime juice`, and a splash `olive oil`.
5. Blend to your preferred consistency, and season to taste.

This salsa turned out great, its citrus-ey and sweet and extremely spicy. 
Its the type of taste that has you crying and going back for more each time the sensation dulls. 
The next time this rolls around I'll most likely tone down the spice a bit but this round was a fun experience.
