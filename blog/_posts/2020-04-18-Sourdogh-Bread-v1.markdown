Sourdough Bread
-
This recipe produces one (1) loaf.  

Ingredients:
- Levain
    - `20 grams` all purpose flour
    - `20 grams` whole wheat flour
    - `20 grams` mature starter 
    - `40 grams` water 
- Dough
    - `405 grams` bread flour (or all purpose)
    - `40 grams` whole wheat flour 
    - `340 grams` water @ 90℉
    - `9 grams` salt
    
    
Steps:
1. Mix `levain ingredients` and rest in a warm area for `5 hours`.
2. `1 hour` before the levain is done, mix together the `bread flour`, `whole wheat flour`, and `290g of the water`. (reserve 50g of water for later)
3. Mix until the dough comes together, then cover with plastic wrap and rest in a warm area for the remaining hour
we are waiting on the levain. 
4. Mix the `dough` and the `levain` together using a bit (but not all) of the reserved `water` to help incorporate it. One
method for incorporation is to pinch the levain into the dough. Let rest for `20 minutes`.
5. Add the `salt` and remaining `water` and mix until incorporated. [Slap and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=717) 
for 2-4 minutes, until the dough is smooth and begins to catch some air. Rest for `15 minutes` in a warm area.
6. Preform 6 sets of [Stretch and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=811) spaced out `15 minutes` apart for the 
first 3 rounds, then spaced out `30 minutes` apart for the last 3. Make sure the dough rests in a warm area in between
stretches.
7. Let your dough rest for a remainder of `1.5 hours` after the final stretching. 
8. Dump out the dough and shape it into a small boule and let sit a few minutes.
9. [Shape your dough](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=938) and place it into bannetons (or a large mixing bowl)
lined with a flour dusted cloth.
10. Chill in the fridge `overnight`.
11. Preheat cast iron dutch oven in the oven from cold to 500℉ for `1 hour`. 
12. Roll parchment paper onto your workbench and flip dough from the bowl onto it. Score the dough with a sharp knife or 
razor blade down the middle at a 45° angle.
13. Pull the dutch oven out and carefully lift and place the parchment paper holding the dough into the dutch oven using 
heat proof gloves. Bake for `20 minutes`.
14. Remove the top from the dutch oven and lower the oven to 450℉ and bake for an additional `20-30 minutes` until the loaf is
a deep brown.
15. Remove the loaf from the dutch oven and let it rest on a wire rack `a few hours` until it is room temperature.

This is the levain and autoleased dough just before combining.

When mixed initially it does not incorporate easily, so it takes some effort and time to get everything absorbed. Here I used the pinching method.

Eventually the dough comes together.

Score the loaf like so before baking. There are other patterns explored in different posts you can also try.

Half way through the baking process the loaf should have risen but will be blond.

After another round of uncovered baking the loaf will darken.

You can see how the score allowed the bread to expand and rise, tearing the scored section apart.
