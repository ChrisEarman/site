Buttermilk Biscuits

Ingredients:
- `13½ oz` all purpose flour
- `2 Tbsp` sugar
- `4 tsp` baking powder
- `½ tsp` baking soda
- `½ tsp` kosher salt
- `2 sticks` frozen butter
- `1¼ cups` buttermilk


Steps:
1. Combing the 13½ oz `all purpose flour`, 2 tablespoons `sugar`, 4 tablespoons `baking powder`,
½ teaspoon `baking soda`, and ½ teaspoon `kosher salt` in a bowl. Whisk with a fork until homogeneous.
2. Use the slightly larger holes in a cheese grater to grate 2 sticks of `frozen butter`
3. add butter to the flour mixture, mix around until all pieces are coated.
4. Add 1¼ cups `buttermilk` to the mixture and give it a good stir 
5. Remove the mixture from the bowl, and continue to coax it together 
into a sort of rectangle. Using a generously floured rolling pin, roll it out to a 16 by 9 inch rectangle
and fold in thirds. 
6. Repeat this process five times.
7. Place dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for
30 minutes to firm up.
8. Roll the dough out to a roughly 9x9 square shape. Trim off the edges using a very sharp knife, dusted in flour.
9. Cut cleanly into 9 square biscuits. You can also form the trimmings into additional biscuits by folding them together 
and rolling them back out. 
10. Place back on the parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with butter.
11. Bake the biscuits at 400℉ for 20-25 minutes.
12. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before consumption
