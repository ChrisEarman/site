Buttermilk Biscuits
-

Ingredients:
- `13½ oz` all purpose flour
- `2 Tbsp` sugar
- `4 tsp` baking powder
- `½ tsp` baking soda
- `½ tsp` kosher salt
- `2 sticks` frozen butter
- `1¼ cups` buttermilk


Steps:
1. Combing the 13½ oz `all purpose flour`, 2 tablespoons `sugar`, 4 tablespoons `baking powder`,
½ teaspoon `baking soda`, and ½ teaspoon `kosher salt` in a bowl. Whisk with a fork until homogeneous.
2. Use the slightly larger holes in a cheese grater to grate 2 sticks of `frozen butter`
3. add butter to the flour mixture, mix around until all pieces are coated.
4. Add 1¼ cups `buttermilk` to the mixture and give it a good stir 
5. Remove the mixture from the bowl, and continue to coax it together 
into a sort of rectangle. Using a generously floured rolling pin, roll it out to a 16 by 9 inch rectangle
and fold in thirds. 
6. Repeat this process five times.
7. Place dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for
30 minutes to firm up.
8. Roll the dough out to a roughly 9x9 square shape. Trim off the edges using a very sharp knife, dusted in flour.
9. Cut cleanly into 9 square biscuits. You can also form the trimmings into additional biscuits by folding them together 
and rolling them back out. 
10. Place back on the parchment-lined baking sheet and brush with butter.
11. Bake the biscuits at 400℉ for 20-25 minutes.
12. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before consumption

The main purpose of this recipe was to make use of the buttermilk I had leftover after making [Cultured Butter](/blog/2020/04/19/Cultured-Butter.html)
from a few weeks prior. I ended up having exactly enough to make this recipe, with exactly enough left over to kick start another batch of the cultured butter.

As I've mentioned in other posts, its important to get all your ingredients out and ready before starting a recipe, especially for 
a recipe like this which calls for frozen butter, where you want to work quickly to prevent it from getting too warm.

Here you can see what shredding the butter looks like. I ended up shredding all of it at once before removing it from the
inside of the cheese grater, this was a mistake as a lot of the butter ended up re-sticking together. To avoid this mistake
you can just make sure to transfer some of the butter shavings to the bowl as you shred the butter.

Here you can see the progression of the dough from a dry, crumbly mass, to a nice smooth dough after its been folded 
onto itself a handful of times.

After the dough is refrigerated, it is then re-rolled out and cut to shape.

Then they are transferred to a baking sheet. Also I pressed the trimmings together, and refolded and re-rolled them 
to make 3 additional biscuits.

Very tasty with some butter + salt, honey butter, or jam.
