Flour Tortilla
_

Ingredients: 
- `300 grams` all-purpose flour
- `50 grams` shortening (room temp)
- `200 ml` warm tap water


Steps:
1. Place the `all-purpose flour` and the room temperature `shortening`
(cut into small pieces) into a food processor. Pulse together 15-20
times, until it forms a mixture similar to wet sand. 
If you don't have a food processor, you can mix by hand, pinching the 
chunks of shortening to incorporate it into the flour until it
reaches the desired, wet sand state. 
2. With the food processor running, add the 200 ml of `warm tap water` 
in through the feeding tube, letting the machine continue to run until 
a ball of dough forms.
3. Once a ball has formed, stop the processor and remove the warm, sticky
dough. Knead for a couple seconds to make sure everything is evenly incorporated.
4. Weigh the dough into evenly-sized balls. Make 6 if you want large tortillas, or 
8 if you want normal sized tortillas. 
5. Place the dough on an oiled pan, oil the tops and cover with plastic wrap. 
Rest at room temp for 1 hour.
6. One at a time, retrieve the balls of dough and dusts both sides with flour.
Roll them out with a well-dusted rolling pin until thin and round as possible. 
7. Once rolled out, heat a cast iron skillet to 400â„‰ or until wisps of smoke 
come off the pan. Plop the dough onto the skillet and let sit for ~90s. Flip 
and let sit another 30-60s. Stack the finished tortillas on a plate wrapped
in a clean dish towel to retain heat.

This is what the flour and shortening look like, unincorporated for context.

I didn't have a food processor so I pinched the shortening into the flour until it resembled wet sand.

At this point we add the warm water to form the dough.

This dough can be rolled and separated into equal pieces, placed on an oiled baking sheet then covered with plastic wrap to sit.

After its rested an hour, we bring out each ball individually onto a liberally floured work bench to roll it out with a 
liberally floured rolling pin. The end result should be a very thin sheet of dough.

Do the best you can to transfer this dough sheet to the preheated cast iron and avoid having the dough fold onto itself 
(which as you can see I failed to do, but it still turned out alright).

The dough will change color as it cooks.

Once you flip it you should see golden brown spots around the bubbles, this picture is of one that was a little under done, so if it yours
are darker than this picture then it is a good thing.

The Finished Product.
