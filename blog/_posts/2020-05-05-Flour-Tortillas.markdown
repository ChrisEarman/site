Flour Tortilla
_

Ingredients: 
- `300 grams` all-purpose flour
- `50 grams` shortening (room temp)
- `200 ml` warm tap water


Steps:
1. Place the `all-purpose flour` and the room temperature `shortening`
(cut into small pieces) into a food processor. Pulse together 15-20
times, until it forms a mixture similar to wet sand. 
If you don't have a food processor, you can mix by hand, pinching the 
chunks of shortening to incorporate it into the flour until it
reaches the desired, wet sand state. 
2. With the food processor running, add the 200 ml of `warm tap water` 
in through the feeding tube, letting the machine continue to run until 
a ball of dough forms.
3. Once a ball has formed, stop the processor and remove the warm, sticky
dough. Knead for a couple seconds to make sure everything is evenly incorporated.
4. Weigh the dough into evenly-sized balls. Make 6 if you want large tortillas, or 
8 if you want normal sized tortillas. 
5. Place the dough on an oiled pan, oil the tops and cover with plastic wrap. 
Rest at room temp for 1 hour.
6. One at a time, retrieve the balls of dough and dusts both sides with flour.
Roll them out with a well-dusted rolling pin until thin and round as possible. 
7. Once rolled out, heat a cast iron skillet to 400â„‰ or until wisps of smoke 
come off the pan. Plop the dough onto the skillet and let sit for ~90s. Flip 
and let sit another 30-60s. Stack the finished tortillas on a plate wrapped
in a clean dish towel to retain heat.
