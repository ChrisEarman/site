Ingredients:
- `200 grams` all purpose flour (`1½ cups`)
- `4 grams` kosher salt (`1¼ tsp` Diamond Crystal or `¾ tsp` Morton kosher salt)
- `4 grams` baking soda (`¾ tsp`)
- `169 grams` unsalted butter, divided (`1½ sticks`)
- `200 grams` dark brown sugar (`1 cup packed`)
- `50 grams` granulated sugar (`¼ cup`)

2. Whisk `flour`, `salt`, and `baking soda` in small bowl.
3. Cook 1 stick of the `butter` in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often
and scraping the bottom with a heatproof spatula until butter foams, then browns,
about 4 minutes. Then transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. 
4. Cut the remaining half stick of `butter` into the warm brown butter, it should melt but not foam or sizzle.
5. Once melted, add both `sugars` and whisk, breaking up any clumps until incorporated. 
6. Add `egg` and `yolks` and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, ~30s. 
7. Whisk in the `vanilla`.
8. Fold `reserved dry ingredients` into butter mixture until no dry spots remain, then fold in `chocolates`
9. Scoop dough into ~16 balls on parchment lined baking sheets.
10. Bake for 8-10 minutes until deep golden brown and firm around the edges.
