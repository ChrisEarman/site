BA's Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies
- 

Ingredients:
- `200 grams` all purpose flour (`1½ cups`)
- `4 grams` kosher salt (`1¼ tsp` Diamond Crystal or `¾ tsp` Morton kosher salt)
- `4 grams` baking soda (`¾ tsp`)
- `169 grams` unsalted butter, divided (`1½ sticks`)
- `200 grams` dark brown sugar (`1 cup packed`)
- `50 grams` granulated sugar (`¼ cup`)
- `1` large egg
- `2` large egg yolks
- `2 tsp` vanilla extract
- `6 oz` bittersweet chocolate chunks / chips

Steps:
1. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven, preheat to 375℉.
2. Whisk `flour`, `salt`, and `baking soda` in small bowl.
3. Cook 1 stick of the `butter` in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often
and scraping the bottom with a heatproof spatula until butter foams, then browns,
about 4 minutes. Then transfer to a heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. 
4. Cut the remaining half stick of `butter` into the warm brown butter, it should melt but not foam or sizzle.
5. Once melted, add both `sugars` and whisk, breaking up any clumps until incorporated. 
6. Add `egg` and `yolks` and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, ~30s. 
7. Whisk in the `vanilla`.
8. Fold `reserved dry ingredients` into butter mixture until no dry spots remain, then fold in `chocolates`
9. Scoop dough into ~16 balls on parchment lined baking sheets.
10. Bake for 8-10 minutes until deep golden brown and firm around the edges.

When baking things with a lot of ingredients, like cookies, I find it really helpful to get everything together measured 
out and close to my work station before I begin mixing anything.

From `Step 3`, the browned butter in a heat proof bowl after caramelizing.

Here we melt the butter from `Step 4` into the warm browned butter.

Here with `Step 5-7` we beat the sugars and egg into the mixture, then add the vanilla.

After adding the dry ingredients in `Step 8` to get the dough to come together.

Then we mix in the chocolate chips.

At this point I should have waited for 10 or so minutes for the dough to hydrate or I should have put it in the fridge to 
sit for a few hours or overnight. But I was impatient and wanted cookies right then so I scooped them out onto trays.
Here you can see how loose the dough still looks, its not quite holding its shape enough and this is due to the flour not 
fully hydrating and absorbing the liquids in the dough yet.

The result of my impatience was flat cookies :(

They were still extremely tasty, but just not quite the end result that I was looking for.
