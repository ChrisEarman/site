Sourdough Bread v2
-
When I baked the first loaf it turned out great, with the exception that the bottom layer of crust came close to burning.
After some research online I modified the following step of the instructions.


> Steps:
>
> +14. Remove the top from the dutch oven **and place the dutch oven on a room temperature baking sheet**, then lower the oven 
to 450â„‰ and bake for an additional `20-30 minutes` until the loaf is a deep brown.


This worked out really well, and I highly recommend using this altered instruction set if you find the bottoms of your loaves
getting too close to burnt.
