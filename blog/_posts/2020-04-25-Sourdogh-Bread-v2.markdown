Sourdough Bread v2
-
This recipe produces one (1) loaf.

Ingredients:
- Levain
    - `20 grams` all purpose flour
    - `20 grams` whole wheat flour
    - `20 grams` mature starter 
    - `40 grams` water 
- Dough
    - `405 grams` bread flour (or all purpose)
    - `40 grams` whole wheat flour 
    - `340 grams` water @ 90℉
    - `9 grams` salt
    
    
Steps:
1. Mix `levain ingredients` and rest in a warm area for `5 hours`.
2. `1 hour` before the levain is done, mix together the `bread flour`, `whole wheat flour`, and `290g of the water`. (reserve 50g of water for later)
3. Mix until the dough comes together, then cover with plastic wrap and rest in a warm area for the remaining hour
we are waiting on the levain. 
4. Mix the `dough` and the `levain` together using a bit (but not all) of the reserved `water` to help incorporate it. One
method for incorporation is to pinch the levain into the dough. Let rest for `20 minutes`.
5. Add the `salt` and remaining `water` and mix until incorporated. [Slap and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=717) 
for 2-4 minutes, until the dough is smooth and begins to catch some air. Rest for `15 minutes` in a warm area.
6. Preform 6 sets of [Stretch and fold](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=811) spaced out `15 minutes` apart for the 
first 3 rounds, then spaced out `30 minutes` apart for the last 3. Make sure the dough rests in a warm area in between
stretches.
7. Let your dough rest for a remainder of `1.5 hours` after the final stretching. 
8. Dump out the dough and shape it into a small boule and let sit a few minutes.
9. [Shape your dough](https://youtu.be/bSYdABrPrtM?t=938) and place it into bannetons (or a large mixing bowl)
lined with a flour dusted cloth.
10. Chill in the fridge `overnight`.
11. Preheat cast iron dutch oven in the oven from cold to 500℉ for `1 hour`. 
12. Roll parchment paper onto your workbench and flip dough from the bowl onto it. Score the dough with a sharp knife or 
razor blade down the middle at a 45° angle.
13. Pull the dutch oven out and carefully lift and place the parchment paper holding the dough into the dutch oven using 
heat proof gloves. Bake for `20 minutes`.
14. Remove the top from the dutch oven and place the dutch oven on a room temperature baking sheet, 
    then lower the oven to 450℉ and bake for an additional `20-30 minutes` 
    until the loaf is a deep brown.
15. Remove the loaf from the dutch oven and let it rest on a wire rack `a few hours` until it is room temperature.

When I baked the first loaf in [v1](/blog/2020/04/18/Sourdogh-Bread-v1.html) it turned out great, 
with the exception that the bottom layer of crust came close to burning.
After some research online I modified the following step of the instructions.

This worked out really well, and I highly recommend using this altered instruction set if you find the bottoms of your loaves
getting too close to burnt.

On my last post I showed the pinching process but didn't show anything about the slap and fold. Here is what your dough
may look like before and after preforming slap and fold. It should go from a loose wet dough, to a more taught dough.

For this round I also attempted to alter my bowl shape and get a longer loaf.

The end produced wasn't drastically changed as far as shape, but the cookie sheet trick did prevent the bottom from getting 
too cooked.

On thing I did notice with this loaf was that I had a tear along the side, possibly my score wasn't long or deep enough 
to let out all the pressure building up inside the loaf. Next time I may try a different score pattern to see if I can 
avoid these types of blow outs.

Just like last time, the crumb was extremely moist and airy, with great stretch and bubble formation.
