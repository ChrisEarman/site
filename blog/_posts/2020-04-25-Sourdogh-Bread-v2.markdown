Sourdough Bread v2
-
When I baked the first loaf it turned out great, with the exception that the bottom layer of crust came close to burning.
After some research online I modified the following step of the instructions.


Steps:
{% highlight diff %}
14. Remove the top from the dutch oven 
>   and place the dutch oven on a room temperature baking sheet, 
    then lower the oven to 450â„‰ and bake for an additional `20-30 minutes` 
    until the loaf is a deep brown.
{% endhighlight %}




This worked out really well, and I highly recommend using this altered instruction set if you find the bottoms of your loaves
getting too close to burnt.

On my last post I showed the pinching process but didn't show anything about the slap and fold. Here is what your dough
may look like before and after preforming slap and fold. It should go from a loose wet dough, to a more taught dough.

For this round I also attempted to alter my bowl shape and get a longer loaf.

The end produced wasn't drastically changed as far as shape, but the cookie sheet trick did prevent the bottom from getting 
too cooked.

On thing I did notice with this loaf was that I had a tear along the side, possibly my score wasn't long or deep enough 
to let out all the pressure building up inside the loaf. Next time I may try a different score pattern to see if I can 
avoid these types of blow outs.

Just like last time, the crumb was extremely moist and airy, with great stretch and bubble formation.
