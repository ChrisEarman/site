I vaguely knew that bacon whiskey was a thing and only really attempted it because I needed to dispose of some bacon grease.
Here I measured out the bacon grease I had and it was about a half ounce.

I then add 4 ounces of a strong bourbon to it to fulfill the 8:1 ratio.

You can see here how the bacon fat is still greasy and liquid.

After freezing overnight it became solid and strainable, you can see the white leftover fat left in the mason jar.

The final product was a lot more smokey then bacon-ey, but still an interesting and worthwhile experiment.
