Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies
- 
These cookies are the same as in my [Peanut Butter Cookies v1](/blog/2020/03/23/Peanut-Butter-Cookies-v1.html)
just with a few modifications to account for them being gluten free. 
When I made this recipe the first time, I also had no granulated sugar, and used a substitute of 
`200g` light brown raw cane sugar + `100g` coconut sugar instead. 

Ingredients:
- `50 grams` glucose
- `225 grams` [gluten free all purpose baking mix](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/gluten-free-all-purpose-baking-mix)
- `1 gram` baking soda
- `9 grams` kosher salt 
- `1 ½ sticks` unsalted butter (room temperature)
- `300 grams` granulated sugar
- `260 grams` creamy peanut butter
- `2` large eggs
- `½ gram` vanilla extract
- `4-6 ounces` high-quality dark chocolate or chocolate chips 

Steps:
Steps:
1. Whisk together `baking mix`, `baking soda`, and `salt`. 
2. Put `butter`, `sugar`, and `glucose` in a bowl.
3. Beat on medium-high for 2-3 minutes until light and fluffy.
4. Scrape sides of the bowl and add the `peanut butter`, mix to combine, ~30s 
5. Add the 2 `eggs` one at a time while mixing until combined, ~30s 
6. Add `vanilla` and beat on high for 3 minutes until light, creamy, and doubled in volume 
7. Scrape sides of the bowl and add the dry ingredients, mixing on low until just combined, ~30s
8. Mix in Chocolate chips 
9. wrap dough in plastic wrap in a tube shape with a cookie sized cross-section
10. Refrigerate overnight, and up to 3-5 days 

Baking Steps:
1. When ready, preheat oven to 350℉ 
2. Link cookie tray with silicon pad, parchment paper, or foil
3. Pull cookie tube from the fridge and cut cookies out of the tube, placing 6-8 per tray 
4. Bake for 8-12min, rotating them after the first 5min and checking every few minutes 
looking for the tops of the cookies to set and making sure the bottoms don't burn.

The really surprising thing about these cookies is that they taste indistinguishable from the glutenous counterparts.
Something with how the peanut butter and sugar whip together help to keep a nice chewy structure in the cookies that make up
for the lack of gluten.
