<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts:</h2>

<p>With all the shelter in place orders going into effect and bars closing
down across the city, I wanted to try out some new cocktails. 
The first that came to mind was the penicillin. 
Since I didn’t have all the ingredients I needed to wait for a grocery store run.
This took place during the initial panic of the pandemic, and the stores were 
pretty baron. 
One result of this panic was that there was no fresh ginger in the store, but there
was fresh ginger paste in a tube… so I got that.
The syrup was still was able to get a strong, natural, ginger flavor with this paste
the only thing to note was that it was more of a process to filter out the ginger
solids than it would have been with tangible cut pieces of ginger.</p>

<p>When I made the drink I ended up making a mixture of the Lemon Juice + syrup that I 
then stored in the fridge for easy access.</p>
